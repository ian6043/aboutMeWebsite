          &emsp; My journey to becoming a Software/Computer engineer started long before I even realized it. My mother told me she knew that 
          I would become some type of engineer when in the 5th grade I cried about my English essay stating “I wish all my classes were like math. 
          Then school would be fun.”. In the 8th grade, I realized that I could choose a more math-oriented path. So I chose to go to a technical school 
          Passaic County Technical Institute and I chose to go into their engineering program. 
          <br><br>
          &emsp;There my freshman engineering teacher exposed me to Python and started teaching the class Python. I enjoyed the challenges 
          he set up for us and I fell in love with the logical thinking I had to do in order to solve the challenges. I loved learning and being 
          able to think of different possible solutions to a problem. Similar to that moment in 5th grade, I thought to myself “If only my classes were all like this. 
          If only I could do this as a job”. I never realized that Computer Science was a thing or that Software Engineering was a career option. 
          In the next 3 years of my high school career, I was given opportunities to program in RobotC for engineering class projects. 
          In group projects, I would always ask my teammates If I could code the project.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;I only realized that Software Engineering was a viable option my first semester at Rutgers. I then took Introduction to 
          Computer Science in the Spring of 2021 and then Introduction to Data Structures in the summer. In that Summer, my eyes were open to the wide 
          variety of topics that could be categorized as Software Engineering. I learned that there was Front-End, Back-End, and Full-Stack Development,
           Embedded Software, Cyber Security, Data Science, Game Development, and others. I discovered that there was so much to explore and so much to learn.
            I started learning the Front-End, I learned HTML and CSS, then I learned a bit of Javascript, then I started working with React.Js and enhanced my Javascript.
            I made a sorting algorithm visualizer to reinforce the topics I learned in my Summer Course.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;I wish to continue learning and practicing my skills and the programming languages I have learned. Learning excites me and
           I can’t wait to take more classes and to continue my journey towards being a Software Engineer.

          &emsp;Rutgers Formula One Racing (RFR) is a club where students plan, design, and build a Formula One car to compete against other schools in multiple categories. 
          Our car is being changed from being a combustion vehicle to an electric vehicle. The team has 8 sub-teams that work on different systems and have their own 
          responsibilities. I am currently a member of 2 subteams. Which are the Data Acquisition/Suspension team and the Electronics/Electric Powertrain team.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;Along with my love for programming, I have also had an admiration for cars. Being on the RFR team allows me to indulge in both. 
          I can develop my skills and get team experience in programming while being able to work on a car. Although I am a new member, I wish to learn as much as
          I can from my seniors and put in as much effort as I can in order to help the team.
          <br><br>
          <h4 style="text-align: center;">Sub-Teams</h4>
          <h5>Data Acquisition/Suspension: </h5>
          <p>
          &emsp;The Data Acquisition team has so few members that it is clumped together with the suspension team. I am on the data acquisition side of the team. 
          The team’s responsibility is to collect data from the various sensors of the car and to parse and analyze the data with Python in order to help the overall 
          decision-making process for the car. The team has to work with other sub-teams in order to obtain the data, run tests, and make changes.
          </p>
          <h5>Electronics/Electric Powertrain: </h5>
          <p>
          &emsp;The Electronics/Electric Powertrain team is a newer team since we changed to an electric vehicle. This sub-team has 3 smaller sub-teams 
          that all work together. There’s High Voltage/Battery, Printed Circuit Board(PCB)/Firmware, and Low Voltage. I am working on the Firmware 
          (which will be programmed in C)and Low Voltage teams.
